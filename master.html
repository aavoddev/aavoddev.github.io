					<p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by English-American rock band the Jimi Hendrix Experience (pictured). Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music. Featuring Jimi Hendrix's songwriting and electric guitar playing, the album established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music. Are You Experienced and its preceding singles were recorded between late October 1966 and early April 1967. Released in the UK in May, the album spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. The US release, issued in August, contained some of Hendrix's best-known songs, including the Experience's first three singles: "Purple Haze", "Hey Joe", and "The Wind Cries Mary". Both the US and UK versions included "Foxy Lady". In 2005, Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced 15th on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. (Full article...)</p>
